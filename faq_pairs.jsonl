{"id": "what_is_hcup", "question": "What is HCUP?", "answer": "The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (called \"H-CUP\") is a family of healthcare databases, software tools, and products developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership and sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). HCUP databases bring together the data collection efforts of State data organizations, hospital associations, private data organizations, and the Federal government to create a national information resource of encounter-level healthcare data. HCUP includes the largest collection of longitudinal hospital care data in the United States, with all-payer, encounter-level information beginning in 1988. HCUP is derived from administrative data originally collected for billing purposes. These databases enable research on a broad range of health policy issues, including cost and quality of health services, medical practice patterns, access to healthcare programs, and outcomes of treatments at the national, State, and local market levels. HCUP also offers free research tools for health services researchers and decision makers using HCUP and other similar administrative databases. The HCUP Software Tools can be applied to HCUP and other administrative databases to create new data elements from existing data, thereby enhancing a researcher's ability to conduct analyses. The HCUP Supplemental Files are available for use with the HCUP databases to enhance a researcher's ability to conduct analyses. These files are not applicable to other administrative databases. HCUP also offers free online query tools. HCUPnet is an online query system that provides immediate access to statistics on hospital inpatient, emergency department, costs, and readmissions. HCUP Fast Stats is an online query tool that uses visual displays to compare national- or State-level statistics on a range of healthcare topics. These visual displays include stand-alone graphs, trend figures, or simple tables to convey complex information at a glance. HCUP offers a variety of online reports, including HCUP Statistical Briefs which present simple, descriptive statistics on a variety of specific topics. For additional information, please visit the Overview of HCUP page and take the Online HCUP Overview Course.", "url": ""}

{"id": "can_i_perform_multi_year_or_trend_analysis_using_the_nis", "question": "Can I perform multi-year or trend analysis using the NIS?", "answer": "Yes, because the NIS spans more than 20 years of data, it is a good tool for longitudinal analysis. However, the NIS has undergone various changes over time, including changes to the sampling and weighting strategies used. The NIS was significantly redesigned for database year 2012. For trend analysis spanning 2012 and earlier years, revised discharge weights should be used to make estimates comparable to the new 2012 NIS design. To perform multi-year or trends analysis using the NIS, AHRQ developed discharge trend weights for the 1993-2011 NIS, specifically the NIS Trend Weight Files. These weights were calculated in the same way that weights were calculated for the redesigned 2012 NIS and are designed to be used instead of the original NIS discharge weights for trend analyses. For trend analyses spanning 2012 and earlier NIS data, trend weights should be used prior to 2012 data to make estimates comparable to the new 2012 NIS design. Use the trend weight (TRENDWT) in place of the original discharge weight (DISCWT) to create national estimates for trend analysis. For 2012 or later data, no trend weight is necessary and the discharge weight supplied on the NIS files can be used. The trend weights are available for download as ASCII files along with SAS®, Stata®, and SPSS® load programs from the HCUP-US website. These revised 1993-2011 trend weights replace the earlier NIS trend weights that were developed for the 1988-1997 NIS following the 1998 NIS redesign.

It aggregates ICD-10-CM/PCS diagnosis and procedures codes into clinically meaningful categories. The CCSR for ICD-10-CM diagnoses groups diagnosis codes into more than 530 clinical categories. It balances the retention of the clinical concepts included in the CCS categories under ICD-9-CM and the specificity of ICD-10-CM diagnoses by creating new clinical categories. The CCSR for ICD-10-CM diagnoses is intended to be used analytically to examine patterns of healthcare in terms of cost, utilization, and outcomes; rank utilization by diagnoses; and risk-adjust by clinical condition. The CCSR for ICD-10-PCS procedures groups procedure codes into more than 320 clinical categories. It capitalizes on the taxonomy and specificity of the ICD-10-PCS coding scheme and, where possible, retains the same surgical concepts from prior CCS versions. The CCSR for ICD-10-PCS procedures is intended to be used analytically to examine patterns of healthcare in terms of cost, utilization, and outcomes, in addition to ranking utilization by procedures. The CCSR replaces the beta version of the CCS for ICD-10-CM/PCS.

{"id": "what_is_the_elixhauser_comorbidity_software_refined_for_icd_10_cm", "question": "What is the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM?", "answer": "The Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM is a product developed by AHRQ that identifies different pre-existing conditions based on secondary diagnoses (i.e., comorbidities) listed on hospital administrative data. This tool creates 38 variables that identify comorbidities (e.g., heart failure, HIV) in hospital discharge records. In health services research, it is often important to control for comorbidities that co-exist at the time of the hospitalization or outpatient encounter, impact resource allocation (e.g., length of stay or charges), and possibly affect outcomes, such as in-hospital mortality. The Elixhauser Comorbidity Software was originally developed using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. The software was translated into ICD-10-CM prior to the availability of ICD-10-CM-coded data and released as a beta version. Once ICD-10-CM-coded data became available, the beta version of the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software was evaluated by clinical experts. The recommended modifications (implemented in v2021.1) transitioned the software tool out of its beta status and into the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM. It is recommended that the beta version of the tool no longer be used. Can the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM be applied to both inpatient and outpatient data? The ICD-9-CM version of this tool was only applicable to inpatient data. Yes, the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM can be applied to both inpatient and outpatient data, however, users should be mindful that the refinement process was focused on adult, nonmaternal inpatient stays. If the tool is being used with outpatient data, some measures like diabetes and obesity may be underreported because of ICD-10-CM coding guidelines for reporting secondary diagnoses on outpatient data, which state: \"Secondary diagnoses should indicate additional conditions that affect patient care in terms of requiring clinical evaluation, therapeutic treatment, diagnostic procedures, extended length of stay, or increased nursing care and/or monitoring.\"2 2 ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting FY 2022 (https://www.cms.gov/files/document/fy-2022-icd-10-cm-coding-guidelines.pdf).", "url": ""}

These data elements are required for the assignment of the comorbidity measures and are identified in the above FAQ. Additionally, the following are common mistakes that are made by users of the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM when applying to HCUP or other administrative databases: Data element names in the input data file do not match the data element names in the SAS Analysis Program Diagnosis codes include decimals Input data file only includes a principal diagnosis, no secondary diagnoses (comorbidity measures are only assigned to secondary diagnoses) Indicators that diagnoses are POA are not coded as expected by the SAS Mapping Program (e.g., \"Y\", \"W\", \"N\", \"U\"). If you continue to encounter issues, we recommend consulting the User Guide for the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM as well as the HCUP Software Tools tutorial, both of which are helpful in identifying what information needs to be modified by the user in the tool's SAS Mapping program.

{"id": "what_are_the_elixhauser_comorbidity_indices_refined_for_icd_10_cm", "question": "What are the Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices Refined for ICD-10-CM?", "answer": "The Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices were originally developed using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and adult, nonmaternal inpatient discharge data.3 The development of the ICD-10-CM version of the indices was consistent with the methodology used for the ICD-9-CM version of the tool but used more recent 2018 data. The Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices Refined for ICD-10-CM is designed to predict two frequently reported health outcomes: Risk of in-hospital mortality Risk of 30-day, all-cause readmission Each index is a separate composite score based on the 38 individual comorbidity measures. Using the indices can be preferable to the individual measures because they account for interaction between comorbidities and reduce the necessary degrees of freedom required for estimation-especially helpful when working with small sample sizes. 3 Moore BJ, White S, Washington R, Coenen N, Elixhauser A. Identifying Increased Risk of Readmission and In-hospital Mortality Using Hospital Administrative Data: The AHRQ Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Med Care. 2017 Jul;55(7):698-705. Can I assign the indices to my administrative data if only a subset of the comorbidity measures is assigned? My administrative data do not include indicators that a diagnosis was POA, which is required for 18 of the comorbidity measures. The Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices Refined for ICD-10-CM depend on all 38 Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM measures being coded in the data. Therefore, your data must include indicators that a diagnosis was present on admission (POA).", "url": ""}

What about a weight of 0?", "answer": "The comorbidity measures are assigned a weight designed to capture the relative risk of in-hospital mortality or a 30-day all-cause readmission of each comorbidity in relation to the other comorbidity measures. For example, a comorbidity with a weight of 5 has five times the weight of a comorbidity with a weight of 1. Some comorbidity weights carry a negative sign, reflecting a protective relationship with in-hospital mortality or readmissions in the context of the other comorbidities. A weight of zero indicates that the comorbidity measure does not significantly contribute positively or negatively to the risk of in-hospital mortality or 30-day all-cause readmission. It is included in the calculation of the index for completeness.", "url": ""}

The CCIR tool identifies three types of conditions: Chronic: Examples include malignant cancer, diabetes, obesity and hypertension Not Chronic: Examples include benign neoplasm, postprocedural complications, pregnancy, and an initial encounter for an injury Codes where no determination was made on the identification of a chronic condition: Examples include external cause of morbidity codes and codes for factors influencing health status and contact with health services.

For example, the codes for Sickle-cell disease without crisis and Sickle-cell disease with acute chest syndrome are both considered chronic. Consistent with the ICD-9-CM version, any diagnosis that indicates an amputation, a transplant, or a malignant cancer is considered a chronic condition. Most congenital codes are chronic. 4 Perrin EC, Newacheck P, Pless IB, Drotar D, Gortmaker SL, Leventhal J, Perrin JM, Stein RE, Walker DK, Weitzman M.

In some cases, more than one diagnosis code on a record may indicate the same chronic condition. In fact, ICD-10-CM coding guidelines require that two diagnosis codes be reported for certain conditions. For example, the record for a patient with hypertensive chronic kidney disease will contain the hypertensive chronic kidney disease code and a code indicating the stage of chronic kidney disease. Both codes will have a CCIR value of chronic. But this does not mean that the patient has two distinct chronic conditions. To address this, the recommendation is to use the CCIR tool in combination with the CCSR for ICD-10-CM diagnoses. It is possible to use the CCSR diagnosis categories to help identify when multiple diagnoses indicate a similar chronic condition.", "url": ""}
