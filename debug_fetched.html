					<li><strong>What is HCUP?</strong> <br /> <br /> The <a
						href="/">Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (called
							&quot;H-CUP&quot;)</a> is a family of healthcare databases, software
						tools, and products developed through a Federal-State-Industry
						partnership and sponsored by the <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/"
						target="_blank">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
							(AHRQ)</a>. HCUP databases bring together the data collection efforts
						of State data organizations, hospital associations, private data
						organizations, and the Federal government to create a national
						information resource of encounter-level healthcare data. <br /> <br />
						HCUP includes the largest collection of longitudinal hospital care
						data in the United States, with all-payer, encounter-level
						information beginning in 1988. HCUP is derived from administrative
						data originally collected for billing purposes. These databases
						enable research on a broad range of health policy issues,
						including cost and quality of health services, medical practice
						patterns, access to healthcare programs, and outcomes of
						treatments at the national, State, and local market levels. <br />
						<br /> <a href="/tools_software.jsp" target="_blank">HCUP
							also offers free research tools</a> for health services researchers
						and decision makers using HCUP and other similar administrative
						databases. The HCUP Software Tools can be applied to HCUP and
						other administrative databases to create new data elements from
						existing data, thereby enhancing a researcher's ability to conduct
						analyses. The HCUP Supplemental Files are available for use with
						the HCUP databases to enhance a researcher's ability to conduct
						analyses. These files are not applicable to other administrative
						databases. <br /> <br /> HCUP also offers free online query
						tools. <a href="https://datatools.ahrq.gov/hcupnet"
						target="_blank">HCUPnet</a> is an online query system that
						provides immediate access to statistics on hospital inpatient,
						emergency department, costs, and readmissions. <a
						href="https://datatools.ahrq.gov/hcup-fast-stats" target="_blank">HCUP
							Fast Stats</a> is an online query tool that uses visual displays to
						compare national- or State-level statistics on a range of
						healthcare topics. These visual displays include stand-alone
						graphs, trend figures, or simple tables to convey complex
						information at a glance. <br /> <br /> HCUP offers a variety of
						online reports, including <a
						href="/reports/statbriefs/sbtopic.jsp" target="_blank">HCUP
							Statistical Briefs</a> which present simple, descriptive statistics
						on a variety of specific topics. <br /> <br /> For additional
						information, please visit the <a href="/overview.jsp"
						target="_blank">Overview of HCUP page</a> and take the <a
						href="/overviewcourse.jsp" target="_blank">Online HCUP
							Overview Course</a>.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>What types of healthcare settings are
							captured in HCUP data?</strong> <br /> <br /> The HCUP databases are
						built from hospital administrative data (i.e., hospital billing
						records). The databases cover hospital inpatient care, outpatient
						emergency department care, and ambulatory surgery and other
						outpatient services from hospital-owned facilities. Some State
						Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases (SASD) include
						ambulatory surgery and services data from facilities not owned by
						a hospital. HCUP does not include services provided in physician
						offices, and does not contain complete or reliable pharmacy,
						laboratory, pathology, or radiology information.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Under the Health Insurance Portability
							and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, how are the HCUP
							databases defined?</strong> <br /> <br /> The HCUP databases are
						consistent with the definition of <a
						href="https://privacyruleandresearch.nih.gov/pr_08.asp"
						target="_blank">limited data sets</a> under the <a
						href="https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy" target="_blank">HIPAA
							Privacy Rule</a> and contain no direct patient identifiers. <a
						href="/tech_assist/dua.jsp" target="_blank">HCUP Data Use
							Agreement (DUA) training</a> and a signed DUA are required to
						purchase and/or use the HCUP databases.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>What is HCUP's unit of analysis?</strong> <br />
						<br /> The unit of analysis in the <a href="/databases.jsp"
						target="_blank">HCUP databases</a> is the <em>discharge
							record</em> for a hospital encounter, not individual patients. This
						means that a person who is admitted to the hospital multiple times
						in one year will have a record for each encounter at the hospital.
					</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>How can I keep informed about HCUP
							activities and product releases?</strong> <br /> <br /> Sign up for the
						<a
						href="https://subscriptions.ahrq.gov/accounts/USAHRQ/subscriber/new"
						target="_blank">HCUP Mailing List</a> to receive emailed
						information about database releases, tools, and other HCUP product
						news. Recent releases are also noted on the HCUP-US homepage in

				<ul>
					<li><strong>What are HCUP's nationwide databases?</strong> <br />
						<br /> HCUP's nationwide databases provide estimates for hospital
						stays, emergency department visits, or major ambulatory surgery
						encounters across the United States. Consisting of the <a
						href="#nis">NIS</a>, <a href="#kid">KID</a>, <a href="#nass">NASS</a>,
						<a href="#nrd">NRD</a>, and <a href="#neds">NEDS</a>, the
						nationwide databases are built from the HCUP <a href="#state">State
							Databases</a>. The databases contain information on all discharges or
						encounters, regardless of expected payers. They can be used to
						create national estimates of healthcare utilization, access,
						charges, quality, and outcomes. The HCUP nationwide databases are
						available for purchase through the <a href="centdist.jsp">HCUP
							Central Distributor</a>. Statistics from select databases are
						available on <a href="#stats">HCUPnet</a>.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Do I need to weight my nationwide
							database data?</strong> <br /> <br /> Yes, HCUP's nationwide databases
						need to be weighted to produce national estimates. HCUP's free <a
						href="#tutorials">online tutorial</a> called <a
						href="tutorials.jsp">Producing National HCUP Estimates</a>
						provides instruction on the process. <br /> <br /> Please note
						that if you are using <a href="#stats">HCUPnet</a> (HCUP's free,
						online query system), the weighting already has been
						applied&mdash;the statistics produced are national estimates.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>When are the nationwide databases
							generally released, and what years of data are available?</strong> <br />
						<br /> The <a href="#nis">NIS</a>, <a href="#nass">NASS</a>, <a
						href="#neds">NEDS</a> and <a href="#nrd">NRD</a>, are released
						annually, approximately 18 to 22 months following the end of a
						calendar year. Data years begin with 1988 for the NIS, 2016 for
						the NASS, 2006 for the NEDS, and 2010 for the NRD. <br /> <br />
						The <a href="#kid">KID</a> is released every 3 years,
						approximately 18 months following the end of a calendar year. Data
						years begin with 1997 and run through 2012. The KID resumed
						release in 2016. <br /> <br /> Complete database availability
						and pricing information is provided in the online <a
						href=" https://www.distributor.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/Databases.aspx"
						target="_blank">HCUP Central Distributor Database Catalog</a>.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>How much do the nationwide databases
							cost?</strong> <br /> <br /> Complete database availability and pricing
						information is included in the online <a
						href=" https://www.distributor.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/Databases.aspx"
						target="_blank">HCUP Central Distributor Database Catalog</a>.
						Cost varies by year of data. Student pricing is available.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Can I perform State-level analyses with
							the nationwide databases?</strong> <br /> <br /> The sampling
						methodology used to create the <a href="/nisoverview.jsp"
						target="_blank">HCUP</a> databases do not include State as a
						stratifier; therefore, analysts cannot use the databases to
						generate State-level estimates. Although the HCUP nationwide
						databases includes weights to allow researchers to generate
						national estimates from the raw counts, no weights are included
						for the calculation of State-level estimates. <br /> <br /> For
						information on State-specific inpatient stays, we recommend that
						you work with the HCUP SID, SASD, or SEDD.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Can the nationwide databases be linked
							together?</strong> <br /> <br /> No. Users are unable to link records
						across the nationwide databases.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Are readmission analyses possible in the
							nationwide databases?</strong> <br /> <br /> Readmission analyses are
						possible in only one nationwide database &ndash; the Nationwide
						Readmissions Database (NRD). For additional information, refer to
						the <a href="#nrd">NRD-specific section of the FAQs</a>.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Is it possible to obtain information on
							intensive care unit (ICU) services in the nationwide databases?</strong> <br />
						<br /> HCUP's nationwide databases do not contain ICU
						information. Information on ICU services is generally available
						via revenue codes, which HCUP's nationwide databases do not
						contain. However, some of the HCUP State databases do contain this
						information (HCUP data elements <a
						href="/db/vars/siddistnote.jsp?var=revcdn" target="_blank">REVCDn</a>
						or <a href="/db/vars/siddistnote.jsp?var=revcode" target="_blank">REVCODE</a>).
						Information on the time in the ICU can be identified by units
						associated with the revenue codes (HCUP data elements <a
						href="/db/vars/siddistnote.jsp?var=unitn" target="_blank">UNITn</a>
						or <a href="/db/vars/siddistnote.jsp?var=units" target="_blank">UNITS</a>).
					</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>What resources are available to validate
							my estimates from the nationwide databases?</strong> <br /> <br /> There
						are several resources available to validate your estimates from
						the nationwide databases. These include:
						<ul>
							<li>HCUP Summary Statistics: These include means on all
								numeric data elements, frequency distributions, and univariates
								on continuous variables. Summary statistics are provided by year
								and for each database-specific file. For the Core File (or for
								the NASS, Encounter File), both unweighted and weighted summary
								statistics are provided. To access the summary statistics for a
								particular year of a HCUP database, select the database from the
								Database Information page on the HCUP-US website, and navigate
								to the "Data Elements"" section of the Database Documentation
								page.</li>
							<li>HCUP Diagnosis and Procedure Frequency Tables: These
								tables include frequency distributions for ICD-9-CM and
								ICD-10-CM/PCS codes (individually and by grouped by clinical
								category including the Clinical Classification Software [CCS]
								for ICD-9-CM, Clinical Classifications Software Refined [CCSR]
								for ICD-10-CM/PCS, and diagnosis-related group [DRG]). For the
								NASS, frequency distributions are available by Clinical
								Classifications Software (CCS) for Services and Procedures
								category. To access these tables, select the database from the
								Database Information page on the HCUP-US website, and navigate
								to the "Data Elements" section of the Database Documentation
								page.</li>
							<li>HCUPnet: An online query system through which users can
								generate statistics and information on inpatient and emergency
								department care as well as population-based healthcare in
								counties. For the nationwide databases, national statistics are
								provided overall as well as by certain diagnosis and procedure
								classifications and for certain patient and hospital
								characteristics. At this time, statistics are not available in
								the ambulatory surgery setting.</li>
						</ul></li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>What are some best practices when working
							with the nationwide databases?</strong> <br /> <br /> To ensure
						researchers' appropriate use of the nationwide databases, AHRQ has
						released a checklist for working with the NIS, KID, NASS, NEDS,
						and NRD. The checklists are available for download on the
						respective nationwide databases' documentation page on the HCUP-US
						website. The checklists help researchers, manuscript peer
						reviewers, and journal editors understand database design,
						strengths and limitations, and how they may have changed over
						time. The checklist provides a step-by-step guide detailing key
						elements to consider when evaluating studies using the HCUP
						nationwide databases. <br /> <br /> Additionally, the checklist
						refers to information resources covering four key topics:
						<ul>
							<li>Data use and acknowledgements</li>
							<li>Research design</li>
							<li>Data analysis</li>
							<li>Transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS.</li>
						</ul> The checklist was derived from the JAMA article titled <em><a
							href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2664461"
							target="_blank">Adherence to Methodological Standards in
								Research Using the National Inpatient Sample</a></em> <a

					<li><strong>What is the National Inpatient Sample
							(NIS)?</strong> <br /> <br /> The <a href="/nisoverview.jsp">National
							Inpatient Sample (NIS)</a> is the largest publicly available
						all-payer inpatient care database in the United States, yielding
						national estimates of hospital inpatient stays. The NIS is a
						database of hospital inpatient stays derived from billing data
						submitted by hospitals to statewide data organizations across the
						U.S. These inpatient data include clinical and resource use
						information typically available from discharge abstracts. The NIS
						is sampled from the State Inpatient Databases (SID), which include
						all inpatient data that are currently contributed to HCUP. The NIS
						is available starting in data year 1988. <br /> <br />
						Additional information on the NIS, including a <a
						href="/db/nation/nis/nisdde.jsp">description of data elements</a>
						and <a href="/db/nation/nis/nissummstats.jsp">summary
							statistics</a>, can be found on the <a
						href="/db/nation/nis/nisdbdocumentation.jsp">NIS Database
							Documentation page</a>. The database can be purchased through the <a
						href="centdist.jsp">HCUP Central Distributor</a>, and statistics
						from the NIS are available on <a href="#stats">HCUPnet</a>.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Can I perform multi-year or trend
							analysis using the NIS?</strong> <br /> <br /> Yes, because the NIS
						spans more than 20 years of data, it is a good tool for
						longitudinal analysis. However, the NIS has undergone various
						changes over time, including changes to the sampling and weighting
						strategies used. The NIS was significantly redesigned for database
						year 2012. For trend analysis spanning 2012 and earlier years,
						revised discharge weights should be used to make estimates
						comparable to the new 2012 NIS design. <br /> <br /> To perform
						multi-year or trends analysis using the NIS, <a
						href="https://www.ahrq.gov/" target="_blank">AHRQ</a> developed
						discharge trend weights for the 1993-2011 NIS, specifically the <a
						href="/db/nation/nis/trendwghts.jsp" target="_blank">NIS Trend
							Weight Files</a>. These weights were calculated in the same way that
						weights were calculated for the redesigned 2012 NIS and are
						designed to be used instead of the original NIS discharge weights
						for trend analyses. <br /> <br /> For trend analyses spanning
						2012 and earlier NIS data, trend weights should be used prior to
						2012 data to make estimates comparable to the new 2012 NIS design.
						Use the trend weight (TRENDWT) in place of the original discharge
						weight (DISCWT) to create national estimates for trend analysis.
						For 2012 or later data, no trend weight is necessary and the
						discharge weight supplied on the NIS files can be used. The trend
						weights are available for download as ASCII files along with
						SAS&reg;, Stata&reg;, and SPSS&reg; load programs from the HCUP-US
						website. <br /> <br /> These revised 1993-2011 trend weights
						replace the earlier NIS trend weights that were developed for the
						1988-1997 NIS following the 1998 NIS redesign. The report <a
						href="/reports/methods/2006_05_NISTrendsReport_1988-2004A.pdf"
						target="_blank">Using the HCUP National Inpatient Sample to
							Estimate Trends</a> (PDF file, 1.0 MB) is available as a <a
						href="/reports/methods/methods.jsp">Methods Series</a> report and
						includes recommendations for trend analysis.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Is it possible to track readmissions in
							the NIS?</strong> <br /> <br /> You cannot track readmissions using the
						NIS; however this can be done using the <a
						href="/db/nation/nrd/nrddbdocumentation.jsp" target="_blank">HCUP
							Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD)</a>, which is a unique and
						powerful database designed to support various types of analyses of
						national readmission rates for all patients regardless of the
						expected payer for the hospital stay. For additional information,
						refer to the <a href="#nrd">NRD section</a> of the HCUP FAQs.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Can I perform State-level analyses with
							the NIS?</strong> <br /> <br /> The sampling methodology used to create
						the <a href="/nisoverview.jsp">NIS</a> does not include <em>State</em>
						as a stratifier; therefore analysts cannot use the database to
						generate State-level estimates. Although the NIS includes weights
						to allow researchers to generate national estimates from the raw
						counts, no weights are included for the calculation of State-level
						estimates. <br /> <br /> For information on State-specific
						inpatient stays, we recommend that you work with the HCUP <a

					<li><strong>What is the Kids' Inpatient Database
							(KID)?</strong> <br /> <br /> The <a href="/kidoverview.jsp">KID</a> is
						the largest publicly available all-payer pediatric inpatient care
						database in the United States, yielding national estimates of
						hospital inpatient stays for patients younger than 21 years of
						age. Unweighted, it contains data from approximately three million
						pediatric discharges each year that can be weighted to make
						national estimates for pediatric care. Weighted, it estimates
						approximately six million hospital stays for children. The KID is
						built from a sample of pediatric discharges from the <a
						href="#sid">SID</a>. <br /> <br /> The KID was released every
						three years from 1997 through 2012 and resumed release again in
						2016. <br /> <br /> Although the KID is released every 3 years,
						the data include discharges for the single calendar year (January
						to December). The KID's large sample size enables analyses of
						common as well as rare conditions, such as congenital anomalies,
						and uncommon treatments, such as organ transplantation. The KID
						includes charge information on all patients, regardless of
						expected payer. <br /> <br /> Additional information on the KID,
						including a <a href="/db/nation/kid/kiddde.jsp">description of
							data elements</a> and <a href="/db/nation/kid/kidsummarystats.jsp">summary
							statistics</a>, can be found on the <a

						statistics from the KID are available on <a href="#stats">HCUPnet</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>How is the KID different from the NIS?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/kidoverview.jsp">KID</a> is based on a stratified, random sample of pediatric discharges (patients younger than 21 years of age) from the <a href="#sid">SID</a>. Ten percent of normal newborns (uncomplicated births) and 80 percent of other pediatric discharges (age 20 years or younger at admission) from 4,000 U.S. community hospitals (defined as short-term, non-Federal, general and specialty hospitals, excluding hospital units of other institutions), excluding rehabilitation hospitals. A large sample size enables analyses of rare conditions (e.g., congenital anomalies) as well as uncommon treatments (e.g., cardiac surgery).</p>
						<p>The NIS does not oversample complicated newborns and other (nonnewborn) pediatric discharges. The NIS, beginning data year 2012, is a sample of discharges of all ages from all hospitals participating in HCUP. The NIS was redesigned in 2012 to improve national estimates; the previous NIS contained all discharge records from a sample of hospitals participating in HCUP.</p>

						<h3>What is the Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (NASS)?</h3>
						<p>The Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample <a href="/nassoverview.jsp">(NASS)</a> is a calendar-year, encounter-level database of selected therapeutic ambulatory surgeries constructed from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases (SASD).</p>
						<p>The ambulatory surgeries selected for inclusion in the NASS are therapeutic procedures which require the use of an operating room, penetrate or break the skin, and involve regional anesthesia, general anesthesia, or sedation to control pain. Procedures intended primarily for diagnostic purposes are excluded. To be considered in-scope for the NASS, ambulatory surgeries are also required to have a relatively high annual volume or aggregate total facility charge. Examples include ambulatory surgeries such as cataract surgery, cholecystectomy, appendectomy, gastric bypass, hysterectomy, hernia repair, spinal fusion, and hip replacement.</p>
						<p>Additional information on the NASS, including a <a href="/db/nation/nass/nassdde.jsp">description of data elements</a> and <a href="/db/nation/nass/nasssummstats.jsp">summary statistics</a>, can be found on the <a href="/db/nation/nass/nassdbdocumentation.jsp">NASS Database Documentation page</a>. The database can be purchased through the <a href="/tech_assist/centdist.jsp">HCUP Central Distributor</a>.</p></li>
					<li>
						<h3>What facilities are included in the NASS?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/nassoverview.jsp">NASS</a> is restricted to hospital-owned facilities in the HCUP <a href="/sasdoverview.jsp">State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases (SASD)</a> that perform in-scope ambulatory surgeries. The designation of a facility as hospital-owned is specific to its financial relationship with a hospital that provides inpatient care and is not related to its physical location. Hospital-owned ambulatory surgery and other outpatient care facilities may be contained within the hospital, physically attached to the hospital, or located in a different geographic area. In addition to restricting attention to hospital-owned facilities, facility selection criteria for the NASS are (1) community nonrehabilitation hospital type and (2) a service type of either general acute care or children's through data year 2018. Beginning data year 2019, the NASS includes specialty hospitals such as surgical, cancer, heart, and orthopedic facilities owned by community hospitals that performed in-scope ambulatory surgeries. Additional restrictions imposed for the NASS sampling frame are that the hospital (1) have no gross irregularities in quarterly reporting volume, (2) submit data to the SASD in all four quarters of the data year, and (3) not have an unusually low volume of encounters containing an in-scope ambulatory surgery.</p>
						<p>The HCUP SASD contain a number of hospital-owned facilities performing in-scope ambulatory surgeries that are not inpatient hospitals. In the NASS, these facilities are assigned the identifier of the hospital owner. Stratification, sampling, weighting, and reporting are performed using the hospital owner identifier and hospital characteristics.</p>
						<p>Additional information about the NASS sampling frame can be found in the Introduction the NASS document on the <a href="/db/nation/nass/nassdbdocumentation.jsp">NASS Database Documentation</a> page.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Are ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) included in the NASS?</h3>
						<p>The NASS is limited to in-scope ambulatory surgeries in hospital-owned facilities. As such, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) that are not owned by a hospital are not captured in the NASS.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What procedures are included in the NASS?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/nassoverview.jsp">NASS</a> is limited to encounters with at least one in-scope ambulatory surgery on the record, performed at hospital-owned facilities. In-scope ambulatory surgeries are defined as therapeutic procedures that require the use of an operating room, penetrate or break the skin, and involve regional anesthesia, general anesthesia, or sedation to control pain. These surgeries are identified by CPT-coded procedures on the billing record, and are categorized as <em>narrow</em> in the <a href="/toolssoftware/surgeryflags_svcproc/surgeryflagssvc_proc.jsp">HCUP Surgery Flag Software</a>. They also belong to a subset of <a href="/toolssoftware/ccs_svcsproc/ccssvcproc.jsp">Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) for Services and Procedures</a> procedure groups with a relatively high volume or aggregate total facility charge, and evidence of reliable reporting from SASD hospitals. For additional information, see the Introduction to the NASS document on the <a href="/db/nation/nass/nassdbdocumentation.jsp">NASS Database Documentation page</a>.</p>
						<p>Note that although encounters are limited to those with at least one in-scope ambulatory surgery on the record, the NASS Supplemental File provides information on other surgical and nonsurgical procedures performed during these encounters.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Can I use the NASS for longitudinal analysis?</h3>
						<p>The NASS can be used for longitudinal analysis. However, users should be aware of changes that have occurred to the NASS design over time. First, procedures considered in-scope can change from year to year. Second, the 2016-2018 NASS undercounted certain emergent surgeries. Last, the NASS universe was modified to include specialty hospitals in data year 2019. Additional information on these changes is available in <a href="/db/nation/nass/NASS_Introduction_2019.jsp#trend" target="_blank">Section 4.8 of the NASS Introduction</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Are all procedure codes included in the NASS?</h3>
						<p>The NASS includes only CPT codes (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level I codes). HCPCS Level II codes are excluded. Procedures that are exclusively or predominantly reported on facility records using HCPCS Level II codes will be underreported in the NASS. For this reason, CCS 45, <em>Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA)</em> was removed from the NASS beginning in 2018.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Would it be possible to see a list of CPT procedure codes that are included in the NASS?</h3>
						<p>Our license agreement with the American Medical Association (AMA) for using CPT codes also does not allow us to distribute lists of individually identified CPT codes. To obtain the definition of individual codes, it may be necessary to license the CPT codes and obtain a CPT Codebook from the <a href="https://commerce.ama-assn.org/store" target="_blank">AMA</a>or work with a medical records coder.</p>
						<p>However, the in-scope ambulatory surgeries defined as selected invasive, therapeutic surgical CPT-coded procedures also belong to a subset of CCS-Services and Procedures procedure categories. For a detailed list of in-scope CCS procedure categories, see the Introduction to the NASS on the <a href="/db/nation/nass/nassdbdocumentation.jsp" target="_blank">NASS Database Documentation</a> page. You can then find the array of CPT and/or HCPCS Level II codes used to assign <a href="/toolssoftware/ccs_svcsproc/ccssvcproc.jsp" target="_blank">CCS-Services and Procedures</a> categories on the CCS-Services and Procedures page of HCUP-US website.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Does the NASS include information on
							ambulatory surgery charges and costs?</strong> <br /> <br /> The NASS
						includes the data element <a href="/db/vars/totchg/nassnote.jsp"
						target="_blank">TOTCHG</a>, which provides the total charges for
						the entire ambulatory surgery encounter. The total charge is not
						attributable to a single procedure. Information on the charge for
						a specific procedure cannot be determined. A Cost-to-Charge Ratio
						(CCR) File is not available for the NASS. As a result, total
						charges for ambulatory surgery encounters in the NASS cannot be
						converted to total facility costs.</li>

						<h3>What is the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS)?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/nedsoverview.jsp">NEDS</a> is the largest publicly available all-payer emergency department (ED) database in the United States, yielding national estimates of ED visits. Unweighted, the NEDS contains approximately 30 million records each year from about 1,000 hospital-owned EDs. Weighted, it estimates over 125 million ED visits. The NEDS approximates a 20 percent stratified sample of U.S. hospital-owned EDs. It is constructed using records from (1) the HCUP <a href="#sedd">State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD)</a>, which capture information on ED visits that do not result in an admission (i.e., treat-and-release visits and transfers to another hospital), and (2) the <a href="#sid">SID</a>, which contain information on patients initially seen in the ED and then admitted to the same hospital. The NEDS includes ED charge information for approximately 96 percent of all U.S. ED visits, regardless of expected payer.</p>
						<p>Additional information on the NEDS, including a <a href="/db/nation/neds/nedsdde.jsp">description of data elements</a> and <a href="/db/nation/neds/nedssummstats.jsp">summary statistics</a>, can be found on the <a href="/db/nation/neds/nedsdbdocumentation.jsp">NEDS Database Documentation page</a>. The database can be purchased through the <a href="/tech_assist/centdist.jsp">HCUP Central Distributor</a>, and statistics from the database are available on <a href="#stats">HCUPnet</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Does the NEDS contain ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM/PCS procedure codes or CPT codes?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/nedsoverview.jsp">NEDS</a> contains both types of procedure codes; however, the type of code(s) depends on the State, year, and the type of ED visit. For ED visits that do not result in hospitalization, procedures may be reported as both ICD-9-CM and CPT, Fourth Edition (CPT-4) procedure codes through data year 2014. Beginning data year 2015, procedures are reported as CPT codes only. These procedures are found in the NEDS Supplemental ED File.</p>
						<p>For ED visits resulting in hospitalization to the same hospital, procedures are coded as ICD-9-CM codes through quarter 3 of data year 2015 (ending September 2015) and ICD-10-PCS codes beginning in quarter 4 of data year 2015 (beginning October 2015). These procedures are found in the NEDS Supplemental Inpatient File</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>How do I differentiate between the two types of ED visits in the NEDS?</h3>
						<p>The NEDS data element, <a href="/db/vars/hcupfile/nedsnote.jsp" target="_blank">HCUPFILE</a>, can be used to differentiate between ED visits that do not result in an admission to the same hospital (HCUPFILE=SEDD) and ED visits that result in admission to the same hospital (HCUPFILE=SID).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Does the NEDS include information on ED charges and costs?</h3>
						<p>The NEDS includes two data elements with information on total charges &ndash; <a href="/db/vars/totchg_ed/nedsnote.jsp" target="_blank">TOTCHG_ED</a>, which provides the total charge of ED services, and <a href="/db/vars/totchg_ip/nedsnote.jsp" target="_blank">TOTCHG_IP</a>, which provides the total charge for ED and inpatient services [ED admissions].</p>
						<p>A <a href="/db/ccr/costtocharge.jsp" target="_blank">Cost-to-Charge Ratio (CCR) File</a> is available for the NEDS beginning data year 2012.  Additional information is available at <a href="/db/ccr/ed-ccr/ed-ccr.jsp" target="_blank">https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/ccr/ed-ccr/ed-ccr.jsp</a>.</p>

					<li><strong>What is the Nationwide Readmissions
							Database (NRD)?</strong> <br /> <br /> The <a href="/nrdoverview.jsp">NRD</a>
						is the largest publicly available all-payer readmissions database
						in the United States that can be used to examine national
						estimates of readmissions. Unweighted, it contains approximately
						18 million discharges each year. Weighted, it estimates
						approximately 35 million discharges. The NRD is drawn from SID
						containing verified patient linkage numbers that can be used to
						track a person across hospitals within a State. <br /> <br />
						Additional information on the NRD, including a <a
						href="/db/nation/nrd/nrddde.jsp">description of data elements</a>
						and <a href="/db/nation/nrd/nrdsummstats.jsp">summary
							statistics</a>, can be found on the <a

						available on <a href="#stats">HCUPnet</a>.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>How are readmissions defined in the NRD?</strong>
						<br /> <br /> The NRD is designed to be flexible to various
						types of analyses of readmissions in the United States for all
						patients, regardless of the expected payer for the hospital stay.
						The NRD does not include any data elements that identify a
						readmission. Instead, the criteria to determine the relationship
						between multiple hospital admissions for an individual patient are
						left to the analyst using the NRD. The NRD can be used to estimate
						national readmission rates, reasons for returning to the hospital
						for care, and the hospital costs for discharges with and without
						readmissions.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Can I conduct a multi-year analysis with
							the NRD?</strong> <br /> <br /> The NRD can be used for analyzing trends
						in readmissions over times for specific conditions or populations.
						However, we strongly recommend that users not combine data years
						with the NRD. Users should consider each year of the NRD as a
						separate sample. The patient linkage numbers (<a
						href="/db/vars/nrd_VisitLink/nrdnote.jsp" target="_blank">NRD_VisitLink</a>)
						do not track the same patient across years of the NRD.
						Additionally, the hospital identifiers (<a
						href="/db/vars/hosp_nrd/nrdnote.jsp" target="_blank">HOSP_NRD</a>)
						do not track the sample hospital across years of the NRD. Each
						year of the NRD should be considered a separate sample.</li>

					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Do I need to weight my State database
							data?</strong> <br /> <br /> HCUP's State databases do not need to be
						weighted. HCUP's State databases provide a census (not an
						estimate) of inpatient stays, ambulatory surgery and other
						outpatient service encounters, or emergency department encounters
						from each participating HCUP Partner. For additional information,

					<li><strong>What years of the State databases are
							available, and how much do they cost?</strong> <br /> <br /> The
						availability and cost of the <a href="/sidoverview.jsp"
						target="_blank">State</a> databases vary by State and year. The
						earliest available years for the State databases are 1990 for the
						SID, 1997 for the SASD, and 1999 for the SEDD; however, not all
						States provide all data types and from every year. <br /> <br />
						Each <a href="/partners.jsp" target="_blank">HCUP Partner</a> sets
						its own pricing, and some charge by applicant affiliation. A <a

					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Are readmission analyses possible with the State databases?</strong> 
					<br /> <br /> Yes, readmission and revisit analyses are possible with the SID, SASD, and SEDD for those HCUP Partners that provide synthetic patient linkage numbers. AHRQ has created the <a href="/toolssoftware/revisit/revisit.jsp" target="_blank">HCUP Supplemental Variables for Revisit Analyses</a> (i.e., revisit variables), which facilitate state-level analyses aimed at tracking patients across time and hospital settings exclusively in the SID, SASD, and/or SEDD, while adhering to strict privacy guidelines. The HCUP revisit variables are available starting in 2003, and only a subset of the HCUP State databases include the revisit variables. To determine which State databases include the revisit variables, refer to the <a href="/toolssoftware/revisit/revisit.jsp#user" target="_blank">User Guide for the Supplemental Variables for Revisit Analyses, Appendix A</a>.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li><strong>Is there a resource that provides

						pertinent information to understand the composition of these
						files.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li>
						<h3>Can State databases be used for county-level analyses?</h3>
						<p>Yes, some State databases include information on the patientâs county of residence. Please note that the HCUP State databases include data for patients treated in hospital in the State. That means that patients residing in one State (e.g., Arizona) who are treated in a hospital in California will have the hospital encounter included in the HCUP State database for California.</p>

						<p>No. The <a href="/seddoverview.jsp">SEDD</a> provide encounter-level information for ED encounters that <em>do not</em> result in an admission to the same facility (i.e., patients being evaluated before transfer to another acute care hospital, being discharged to their home or to rehabilitation/long-term care health facility, leaving against medical advice, or dying in the ED before admission). Records for inpatient stays in which the patient was admitted to the same hospital through the ED are found in the <a href="#sid">SID</a>. These records can be identified by the data element <a href="/db/vars/siddistnote.jsp?var=hcup_ed" target="_blank">HCUP_ED</a>. Both the SEDD and SID are needed to analyze all ED encounters in a State.</p>

						<h3>How can I access data or statistics from HCUP?</h3> 
						<p>The HCUP databases are available for purchase online through the <a href="/tech_assist/centdist.jsp">HCUP Central Distributor</a>. All purchasers must complete the online <a href="/tech_assist/dua.jsp">HCUP Data Use Agreement (DUA) Training</a> and create an HCUP Central Distributor user account in order to submit an application to purchase HCUP data. Please see <a href="#PurchasingFAQ">HCUP Central Distributor FAQs</a> for additional information.</p>
						<p>Statistics and data tables from HCUP's nationwide and select State databases can be obtained from <a href="https://datatools.ahrq.gov/hcupnet" target="_blank">HCUPnet</a>, a free, online query system. Statistics and data tables on select topics are also available through <a href="https://datatools.ahrq.gov/hcup-fast-stats">HCUP Fast Stats</a>.The HCUP Summary Trend Tables provide State-specific monthly trends in hospital utilization accessed through downloadable tables. The HCUP Visualization of Inpatient Trends in COVID-19 and Other Conditions displays State-specific monthly trends in inpatient stays related to COVID-19 and other conditions, and facilitates comparisons across patient/stay characteristics and States.</p>
						<p>HCUP is a voluntary partnership between the Federal government and State data organizations (<a href="/partners.jsp">HCUP Partners</a>). Each Partner determines how its data are used in HCUP; thus, not all States participate in the HCUP Central Distributor, <a href="#stats">HCUPnet</a>,  Fast Stats, HCUP Summary Trend Tables, and/or HCUP Visualization of Inpatient Trends. <a href="/partners.jsp">https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/partners.jsp</a></p></li>

						<h3>Can I obtain a customized dataset or access additional elements that are not included in the standard HCUP databases? Can I get a sample/preview the databases?</h3>
						<p>HCUP does not offer customized datasets&#8212;the data are offered as standard databases. No elements beyond those that already are included in the standard databases are available to the public. Due to restrictions regarding data confidentiality, HCUP is unable to provide a sample data set. We suggest reviewing data in HCUPnet, our free online query system, to explore topics of interest and become familiar with the content.</p>

									Reporting System</a>. What should I do?
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p>To download the HCUP Nationwide databases, log in and
							access the Order-Download page using the 'Chrome' browser for
							downloading file. Please ensure that you have a stable and
							high-speed network while downloading. Do not refresh the page or
							lock the screen or work on other tasks during the downloading
							(indicated by a spinning circle), especially the main file.</p>
						<p>The length of time to download the Nationwide databases can
							vary. Download performance depends on several highly variable
							factors including the following:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>internet connection speed and bandwidth,</li>
							<li>global and regional internet traffic demand at the time
								of your download,</li>
							<li>other users&apos; demand on your network or internet
								service provider (ISP) resources at the time of your download,
								and</li>
							<li>the size of the file to be downloaded (some files are
								~2GB that take around 4 minutes to complete on a stable and fast
								internet).</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Please refer to the <a
								href="/pdf/HCUP_Central_Distributor_User_Guide.pdf"
								target="_blank">HCUP Central Distributor User Guide</a> to
							troubleshoot the issue. If the information provided in the Guide

						<p>
							<strong>The files that I received do not unzip, what
								should I do?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							HCUP databases use a process that compresses and encrypts the
							files into a password-protected file (in either zip or exe
							format) which only can be extracted or unzipped using a
							third-party zip utility such as <a
								href="https://www.pkware.com/products/securezip" target="_blank"
								rel="noopener noreferrer">SecureZIP<sup>&reg;</sup></a>, <a
								href="https://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank"

							using the built-in zip utilities in Windows<sup>&reg;</sup>
							(Windows Explorer) or Mac (Archive Utility) will produce an error
							message warning of incorrect password and/or corrupted file or
							folder errors.
						</p>

						<p>To extract the zipped files, please follow these steps using 7-Zip (PC) or Keka (Mac):</p>
						<ol type="1">
							<li>Right-click the compressed file (the outer layer, e.g., KID_YYYY).</li>
							<li>Open with "7-Zip" from the context menu.</li>
							<li>Choose "Extract to "outer layer/"".</li>
							<li>Enter the password for specific file.</li>
							<li>Then, extract the second layer using the same way as above.</li>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>What are the HCUP software tools?</strong> <br />
						<br /> The HCUP software tools can be applied to HCUP and other
						administrative databases to create new data elements from existing
						data, thereby enhancing a researcher's ability to conduct
						analyses. The HCUP software tools are available for download from
						the HCUP-US website and are free of charge. Additional information
						is available in the <a href="/tools_software.jsp" target="_blank">Research
							Tools</a> section of the HCUP-US website.</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li>
						<h3>How often are the HCUP software tools updated?</h3> 
						<p>The HCUP software tools are updated annually. For this reason, it is always advisable to use the most recent version of the tool.</p>
						<p>The HCUP software tools for ICD-9-CM are no longer updated. These tools should be used only for administrative data before October 2015.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What is the Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) for ICD-10-CM/PCS?</h3>
						<p>The CCSR is a diagnosis and procedure categorization scheme developed by AHRQ. It aggregates ICD-10-CM/PCS diagnosis and procedures codes into clinically meaningful categories.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The <a href="/toolssoftware/ccsr/dxccsr.jsp"
								target="_blank">CCSR for ICD-10-CM diagnoses</a> groups
								diagnosis codes into more than 530 clinical categories. It
								balances the retention of the clinical concepts included in the
								CCS categories under ICD-9-CM and the specificity of ICD-10-CM
								diagnoses by creating new clinical categories. The CCSR for
								ICD-10-CM diagnoses is intended to be used analytically to
								examine patterns of healthcare in terms of cost, utilization,
								and outcomes; rank utilization by diagnoses; and risk-adjust by
								clinical condition.
							</li>
							<li>The <a href="/toolssoftware/ccsr/prccsr.jsp"
								target="_blank">CCSR for ICD-10-PCS procedures</a> groups
								procedure codes into more than 320 clinical categories. It
								capitalizes on the taxonomy and specificity of the ICD-10-PCS
								coding scheme and, where possible, retains the same surgical
								concepts from prior CCS versions. The CCSR for ICD-10-PCS
								procedures is intended to be used analytically to examine
								patterns of healthcare in terms of cost, utilization, and
								outcomes, in addition to ranking utilization by procedures.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The CCSR replaces the beta version of the CCS for ICD-10-CM/PCS. The beta version of the CCS for ICD-10-CM/PCS codes will not be updated for newer codes (ICD-10-CM codes after October 2019 and ICD-10-PCS codes after October 2020). It is recommended that the beta version of the tool no longer be used.</p>
					</li>
					<br />
					<br />
					<li>
						<h3>The assignment of CCSR categories in the CCSR for ICD-10-CM diagnoses tool is not mutually exclusive. How do I account for this if my analysis is limited to reporting by the principal diagnosis (DX1)?</h3>
						<p>For some applications, a mutually exclusive categorization scheme is needed, for example, performing rank utilization by the principal (or first-listed) diagnosis. To facilitate such analyses, the CCSR tool includes the assignment of a default CCSR category for the principal diagnosis in inpatient data and the first-listed diagnosis in outpatient data. Correct application would be dependent upon your dataset's setting of care. Additional information is available in the <a href="/toolssoftware/ccsr/ccs_refined.jsp#overdiagnoses" target="_blank">User Guide for the CCSR for ICD-10-CM diagnoses</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>I am having problems applying the CCSR for ICD-10-CM diagnoses to my administrative data. What could be the issue(s)?</h3>
						<p>Please note the input dataset must contain certain elements that are coded in specific ways. These data elements are required for the assignment of the CCSR for ICD-10-CM categories:</p>
						<ul>

						<h3>What is the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/toolssoftware/comorbidityicd10/comorbidity_icd10.jsp" target="_blank">Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM</a> is a product developed by AHRQ that identifies different pre-existing conditions based on secondary diagnoses (i.e., comorbidities) listed on hospital administrative data. This tool creates 38 variables that identify comorbidities (e.g., heart failure, HIV) in hospital discharge records. In health services research, it is often important to control for comorbidities that co-exist at the time of the hospitalization or outpatient encounter, impact resource allocation (e.g., length of stay or charges), and possibly affect outcomes, such as in-hospital mortality.</p>
						<p>The Elixhauser Comorbidity Software was originally developed using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. The software was translated into ICD-10-CM prior to the availability of ICD-10-CM-coded data and released as a beta version. Once ICD-10-CM-coded data became available, the beta version of the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software was evaluated by clinical experts. The recommended modifications (implemented in v2021.1) transitioned the software tool out of its beta status and into the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM. It is recommended that the beta version of the tool no longer be used.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Can the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM be applied to both inpatient and outpatient data? The ICD-9-CM version of this tool was only applicable to inpatient data.</h3>
						<p>Yes, the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM can be applied to both inpatient and outpatient data, however, users should be mindful that the refinement process was focused on adult, nonmaternal inpatient stays.</p>
						<p>If the tool is being used with outpatient data, some measures like diabetes and obesity may be underreported because of ICD-10-CM coding guidelines for reporting secondary diagnoses on outpatient data, which state: &quot;Secondary diagnoses should indicate additional conditions that affect patient care in terms of requiring clinical evaluation, therapeutic treatment, diagnostic procedures, extended length of stay, or increased nursing care and/or monitoring.&quot;<sup>2</sup></p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>I noticed that the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM is applied to all HCUP nationwide databases beginning data year 2019 except the KID. Why is that?</h3>
						<p>As noted in the above FAQ, the refinement process for the
						Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM focused on
						adult, nonmaternal inpatient stays. Additional work needs to be
						done to understand using the comorbidity measures for studying
						pediatric hospitalizations before it can be included on the KID.
						Some measures like dementia may not apply to the pediatric
						population and other comorbidities of possible interest (e.g.,
						sickle-cell anemia) are not included.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>I am getting a value of 0 for all comorbidity measures in the output dataset. What could be wrong?</h3>
						<p>Please note the input dataset must contain certain
						elements that are coded in specific ways. These data elements are
						required for the assignment of the comorbidity measures and are
						identified in the above FAQ.</p>
						<p>Additionally, the following are common mistakes that are made by users of the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM when applying to HCUP or other administrative databases:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Data element names in the input data file do not match
								the data element names in the SAS Analysis Program</li>
							<li>Diagnosis codes include decimals</li>
							<li>Input data file only includes a principal diagnosis, no
								secondary diagnoses (comorbidity measures are only assigned to
								secondary diagnoses)</li>
							<li>Indicators that diagnoses are POA are not coded as
								expected by the SAS Mapping Program (e.g., "Y", "W", "N", "U").</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you continue to encounter issues, we recommend consulting the <a href="/toolssoftware/comorbidityicd10/comorbidity_icd10.jsp" target="_blank">User Guide for the Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM</a> as well as the HCUP Software Tools tutorial, both of which are helpful in identifying what information needs to be modified by the user in the tool's SAS Mapping program. If SAS is unavailable for use, we suggest that the SAS code be used as a guide for the necessary steps in other programming languages.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What are the Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices Refined for ICD-10-CM?</h3>
						<p>The Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices were originally developed using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and adult, nonmaternal inpatient discharge data.<sup>3</sup> The development of the ICD-10-CM version of the indices was consistent with the methodology used for the ICD-9-CM version of the tool but used more recent 2018 data.</p>
						<p>The <a href="/toolssoftware/comorbidityicd10/comorbidity_icd10.jsp" target="_blank">Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices Refined for ICD-10-CM</a> is designed to predict two frequently reported health outcomes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Risk of in-hospital mortality</li>
							<li>Risk of 30-day, all-cause readmission</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Each index is a separate composite score based on the 38 individual comorbidity measures. Using the indices can be preferable to the individual measures because they account for interaction between comorbidities and reduce the necessary degrees of freedom required for estimation-especially helpful when working with small sample sizes.</p>
						<p><sup>3</sup> Moore BJ, White S, Washington R, Coenen N, Elixhauser A. Identifying Increased Risk of Readmission and In-hospital Mortality Using Hospital Administrative Data: The AHRQ Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Med Care. 2017 Jul;55(7):698-705.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Can I assign the indices to my administrative data if only a subset of the comorbidity measures is assigned? My administrative data do not include indicators that a diagnosis was POA, which is required for 18 of the comorbidity measures.</h3>
						<p>The Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices Refined for ICD-10-CM depend on all 38 Elixhauser Comorbidity Software Refined for ICD-10-CM measures being coded in the data. Therefore, your data must include indicators that a diagnosis was present on admission (POA).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>How do I interpret the comorbidity measures with a negative weight? What about a weight of 0?</h3>
						<p>The comorbidity measures are assigned a weight designed to capture the relative risk of in-hospital mortality or a 30-day all-cause readmission of each comorbidity in relation to the other comorbidity measures. For example, a comorbidity with a weight of 5 has five times the weight of a comorbidity with a weight of 1. Some comorbidity weights carry a negative sign, reflecting a protective relationship with in-hospital mortality or readmissions in the context of the other comorbidities. A weight of zero indicates that the comorbidity measure does not significantly contribute positively or negatively to the risk of in-hospital mortality or 30-day all-cause readmission. It is included in the calculation of the index for completeness.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What is the Chronic Condition Indicator Refined (CCIR) for ICD-10-CM?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/toolssoftware/chronic_icd10/chronic_icd10.jsp" target="_blank">CCIR for ICD-10-CM</a> is a tool developed by the AHRQ that facilitates health services research by allowing the researcher to readily identify a diagnosis as indicating a chronic condition. The CCIR tool identifies three types of conditions:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Chronic: Examples include malignant cancer, diabetes, obesity and hypertension</li>
							<li>Not Chronic: Examples include benign neoplasm, postprocedural complications, pregnancy, and an initial encounter for an injury</li>
							<li>Codes where no determination was made on the identification of a chronic condition: Examples include external cause of morbidity codes and codes for factors influencing health status and contact with health services.</li>
						</ul> 
						<p>The CCIR for ICD-10-CM replaces the beta version of the CCI for ICD-10-CM. It is recommended that the beta version of the tool no longer be used.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What is the definition of a chronic condition in the CCIR for ICD-10-CM tool?</h3>
						<p>The definition of a chronic condition is dependent on duration (a condition lasting 12 months of longer) and its effect on the patient based one or both of the following criteria:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The condition results in the need for ongoing intervention with medical products, treatment, services, and special equipment</li>
							<li>The condition places limitations on self-care, independent living, and social interactions.<sup>4</sup></li>
						</ul>
						<p>A diagnosis code that describes a chronic condition fitting the above definition is considered chronic, even if the code description includes information on an acute exacerbation. For example, the codes for Sickle-cell disease without crisis and Sickle-cell disease with acute chest syndrome are both considered chronic.</p>
						<p>Consistent with the ICD-9-CM version, any diagnosis that indicates an amputation, a transplant, or a malignant cancer is considered a chronic condition. Most congenital codes are chronic.</p>
						<p><sup>4</sup> Perrin EC, Newacheck P, Pless IB, Drotar D, Gortmaker SL, Leventhal J, Perrin JM, Stein RE, Walker DK, Weitzman M. Issues involved in the definition and classification of chronic health conditions. Pediatrics. 1993 Apr;91(4):787-93.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Does the CCIR for ICD-10-CM value, Not Chronic, indicate an acute condition?</h3>
						<p>The designation of not chronic is not synonymous with acute. For example, diagnoses indicating pregnancy, or a benign neoplasm are not chronic, but also not an acute condition requiring immediate short-term treatment.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>How should the CCIR for ICD-10-CM be used for an analysis that counts chronic conditions?</h3>
						<p>The CCIR for ICD-10-CM tool assigns a value to every diagnosis code and identifies any diagnosis on a record that is chronic. In some cases, more than one diagnosis code on a record may indicate the same chronic condition. In fact, ICD-10-CM coding guidelines require that two diagnosis codes be reported for certain conditions. For example, the record for a patient with hypertensive chronic kidney disease will contain the hypertensive chronic kidney disease code and a code indicating the stage of chronic kidney disease. Both codes will have a CCIR value of chronic. But this does not mean that the patient has two distinct chronic conditions.</p>
						<p>To address this, the recommendation is to use the CCIR tool in combination with the CCSR for ICD-10-CM diagnoses. It is possible to use the CCSR diagnosis categories to help identify when multiple diagnoses indicate a similar chronic condition.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>What is the Procedure Classes Refined for ICD-10-PCS?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/toolssoftware/procedureicd10/procedure_icd10.jsp" target="_blank">Procedure Classes Refined for ICD-10-PCS</a> facilitates health services research by allowing the researcher to readily determine (1) whether a procedure is diagnostic or therapeutic and (2) whether a procedure is expected to be performed in an operating room. The Procedure Classes Refined for ICD-10-PCS assign all ICD-10-PCS procedure codes to one of four categories:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Minor Diagnostic: Nonoperating room procedures that are diagnostic (e.g., B244ZZZ, Ultrasonography of Right Heart)</li>
							<li>Minor Therapeutic: Nonoperating room procedures that are therapeutic (e.g., 02HQ33Z, Insertion of Infusion Device into Right Pulmonary Artery, Percutaneous Approach)</li>
							<li>Major Diagnostic: Procedures that are considered operating room procedures that are performed for diagnostic reasons (e.g., 02BV0ZX, Excision of Superior Vena Cava, Open Approach, Diagnostic)</li>
							<li>Major Therapeutic: Procedures that are considered operating room procedures that are performed for therapeutic reasons (e.g., 0210093, Bypass Coronary Artery, One Site from Coronary Artery with Autologous Venous Tissue, Open Approach).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The Procedure Classes Refined for ICD-10-PCS replaces the beta version of the tool. The beta version of the Procedure Classes will not be updated for newer codes and it is recommended that it no longer be used.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What is the Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) for Services and Procedures?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/toolssoftware/ccs_svcsproc/ccssvcproc.jsp" target="_blank">CCS for Services and Procedures</a> provides a method for classifying CPT and HCPCS Level II codes into more than 240 clinically meaningful procedure categories. The procedure categories are similar to the Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) for ICD-9-CM procedure classification with the addition of specific categories unique to the professional service and supply codes in CPT and HCPCS Level II codes.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Will the CCS-Services and Procedures be updated to align with the new CCSR for ICD-10-CM diagnoses categories?</h3>
						<p>While we understand that there is a need for this, especially for analyses that examine procedure trends within the inpatient and outpatient settings, we do not yet have a plan to update the CCS-Services and Procedures categories to align with the CCSR for ICD-10-CM diagnoses.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What is the Surgery Flags Software for Services and Procedures?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/toolssoftware/surgeryflags_svcproc/surgeryflagssvc_proc.jsp" target="_blank">Surgery Flags Software for Services and Procedures</a> identifies a subset of CPT codes as surgical procedures:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>CPT Category I, Surgery procedures</li>
							<li>CPT Category I, Radiology procedures (added in v2019.2)</li>
							<li>CPT Category I, Medicine services and procedures (added in v2019.2), excluding the evaluation and management codes</li>
							<li>CPT Category III Codes, Temporary codes for emerging or experimental services, technology, or procedures (added v2018)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Excluded are all other ranges of CPT Category I codes
						(i.e., codes specific to anesthesia, pathology and laboratory
						procedures, evaluation and management services, laboratory
						analyses, multianalyte assay), any CPT Category II codes, and all
						HCPCS Level II codes.</p>
						<p>CPT codes in the specified ranges are classified as one of three categories:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A narrowly defined surgery (Narrow) that is usually a major therapeutic procedure</li>
							<li>A more broadly defined surgery (Broad) that includes major diagnostic and invasive minor therapeutic procedures</li>
							<li>Neither a narrowly nor broadly defined surgery (Neither)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Are the CCS- and Surgery Flags-Services and Procedures tools valid for all calendar years?</h3>
						<p>Beginning with the v2020.1 release of the CCS-Services and Procedures and Surgery Flags-Services and Procedures, the tools are based on CPT and HCPCS Level II codes valid as of the calendar year.</p>
						<p>For users interested in applying the CCS-Services and Procedures and Surgery Flags-Services and Procedures to CPT and HCPCS Level II codes valid before January 1, 2020, older versions are archived for download on the HCUP-US website at <a href="/toolssoftware/ccs_svcsproc/ccssvcproc.jsp" target="_blank">www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs_svcsproc/ccssvcproc.jsp</a> and <a href="/toolssoftware/surgeryflags_svcproc/surgeryflagssvc_proc.jsp" target="_blank">www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/surgeryflags_svcproc/surgeryflagssvc_proc.jsp</a> respectively.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Is a reference file available for the CCS-and Surgery Flags-Services and Procedures tools that lists the CPT or HCPCS Level II codes mapped into respective CCS categories or surgery flag values?</h3>
						<p>While a reference file is available for both tools, HCUP does not provide lists of individual CPT or HCPCS Level II codes for either of these tools. The CCS-Services and Procedures category and surgery flag mappings are provided as code ranges that can be recognized by a statistical package like SAS or SPSS. Descriptions of the code ranges are not provided. Our license agreement with the AMA for using CPT codes also does not allow us to distribute individual codes. To obtain individual codes, it may be necessary to license the CPT codes and obtain a CPT Codebook from the <a href="https://commerce.ama-assn.org/store" target="_blank">AMA</a> <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/externaldisclaimer.html"><img src="/images/exit_disclaimer.jpg" alt="Exit Disclaimer" title="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0"></a> or work with a medical records coder to develop a list.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What are the HCUP software tools for ICD-9-CM?</h3>

						<h3>What are the HCUP Supplemental Files?</h3>
						<p>The HCUP Supplemental Files are available for use with the HCUP databases to enhance a researcher's ability to conduct analyses. These files are not applicable to other administrative databases. Most of these files are available for download from the HCUP-US website. Others may be ordered through the online HCUP Central Distributor. All are available free of charge.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What are the American Hospital Association (AHA) Linkage Files?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/db/state/ahalinkage/aha_linkage.jsp" target="_blank">HCUP AHA Linkage Files</a> are used to supplement the HCUP SID, SASD, and SEDD with hospital-level information from the AHA Annual Survey Databases. The AHA Annual Survey Databases are not available through HCUP and must be purchased separately from the <a href="http://www.ahadata.com/aha-annual-survey-database" target="_blank">AHA</a> <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/externaldisclaimer.html"><img src="/images/exit_disclaimer.jpg" alt="Exit Disclaimer" title="Exit Disclaimer" width="12" height="12" border="0"></a>. The HCUP AHA Linkage Files include the hospital identifier used on the AHA Annual Survey Databases and the HCUP hospital identifier for those HCUP Partner States that release hospital identifiers.</p>
						<p>The HCUP AHA Linkage Files for most states that release hospital identifiers are available to download from HCUP-US for the HCUP Central Distributor SID, SASD, and SEDD beginning with 2006 data. The AHA Linkage Files are updated annually. The HCUP AHA Linkage Files prior to 2006 were included on the data CD-ROMs provided with purchase. Please note that not all HCUP Partner States release hospital identifiers.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>How do I link the HCUP AHA Linkage Files with the HCUP SID, SASD, and SEDD?</h3>
						<p>The HCUP AHA Linkage Files can be linked to the HCUP SID, SASD, and SEDD Core Files using the HCUP data source hospital identification number (data element DSHOSPID). Then, subsequently, users can merge the data elements of interest from the AHA Annual Survey Databases to the HCUP AHA Linkage Files using the AHA hospital identifier (data element AHAID).</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>I recently received the Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska AHA Linkage Files through special request from the HCUP Central Distributor. How do I link the AHA Linkage Files for these three States to the corresponding SID, SASD, and SEDD?</h3>
						<p>The Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska AHA Linkage Files are provided by special request to certain approved purchasers whose use of the data is consistent with the Partner organization's requirements. These special request files are discharge-level files rather than hospital-level files. There is one record in these AHA Linkage Files for every record in the State database. For these three States, the AHA Linkage Files can be linked directly to the SID, SASD, and SEDD Core Files using the HCUP record identifier (data element KEY).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>What are the Cost-to-Charge Ratio Files (CCR) Files?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/db/ccr/costtocharge.jsp" target="_blank">CCR Files</a> are linkable files developed by AHRQ that enable the conversion of total charges (defined as the amount a hospital billed for services) into how much the hospital services actually cost. Cost information was obtained from the hospital accounting reports in the Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS) files collected by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). Some imputations for missing values were necessary. The CCR Files are hospital-level files designed to supplement the data elements in HCUP inpatient and emergency department databases.</p>
						<p>Each CCR File contains hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios based on all-payer inpatient or emergency department cost for nearly every hospital in the corresponding database (NIS, KID, NRD, NEDS, SID, and SEDD). The CCR Files for inpatient data are updated annually for the NIS, NRD, and SID and every 3 years for the KID (beginning with 2001 data). The CCR files for emergency department data are updated annually for the NEDS and SEDD (beginning with 2012 data).</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>How do I link the CCR Files to the HCUP
							databases?</strong> <br /> <br /> The CCR Files can be linked to records
						in the HCUP databases using the HCUP hospital identification
						number, which is a unique hospital number exclusive to the HCUP
						data. The name of the data element representing the hospital
						identification number varies by database and data year. <br /> <br />
						For nationwide database CCR Files (CCR-NIS, CCR-KID, CCR-NRD, and
						CCR-NEDS), the CCR records can be merged directly with the records
						in the corresponding database using the database's hospital
						identification number (HOSP_NIS, HOSP_KID, HOSP_NRD, and HOSP_ED,
						respectively). <br /> <br /> For States that release an HCUP AHA
						Linkage File, linkage between the CCR File and the SID or SEDD is
						achieved in two steps. First by linking records from the CCR for
						SID or SEDD file to the HCUP AHA Linkage File by the data element
						HOSPID. For Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska, this linkage is
						achieved using the data element KEY. Second, by linking the
						resulting file to the SID or SEDD by State (data element Z013) and
						data element DSHOSPID. <br /> <br /> For States that do not
						release an HCUP AHA Linkage File, HOSPID is included directly on
						their SID or SEDD file. For these States, the data elements from
						the CCR File can be merged onto the SID or SEDD by HOSPID.</li>

					<li>
						<h3>What are the Supplemental Variables for Revisit Analyses?</h3>
						<p>The <a href="/toolssoftware/revisit/revisit.jsp" target="_blank">HCUP Supplemental Variables for Revisit Analyses</a>, or revisit variables, are additional variables that were developed by AHRQ. They facilitate analyses to track patients across time and hospital settings exclusively in the SID, SASD, and SEDD while adhering to strict privacy guidelines.</p>
						There are two HCUP supplemental variables
						<ul>
							<li>Synthetic person-level identifiers that have been verified against the patient's date of birth and sex and examined for completeness (HCUP variable VisitLink).</li>
							<li>A timing variable that can be used to determine the days between hospital events for an individual without the use of actual dates (HCUP variable DaysToEvent).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Beginning with 2009 data, the Revisit Variables are included in the Core file of the SID, SASD, and SEDD databases for select States purchased through the HCUP Central Distributor. For 2003-2008 data, the Revisit Variables are provided free of charge as a separate file with the applicable state databases.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Which States, databases, and years have Revisit Variables?</h3>
						<p>Appendix A of the <a href="/toolssoftware/revisit/revisit.jsp" target="_blank">HCUP Supplemental Variables for Revisit Analyses User Guide</a> provides a detailed list of which States, years, and types of data are available.</p>
					</li>
					<li><strong>How do I determine if I can follow
							patients over time in a State?</strong> <br /> <br /> It is possible
						that over time, some HCUP Partners will modify the encryption
						routines used for their synthetic patient linkage numbers. If this
						occurs, there will be a one-time disruption in the ability to
						track a patient over time. For more information, review Appendix C
						of the <a href="/toolssoftware/revisit/revisit.jsp"

						<h3>How is HCUPnet different from the full HCUP databases?</h3>
						<p><a href="https://datatools.ahrq.gov/hcupnet" target="_blank">HCUPnet</a> produces output by accessing precalculated statistics, tables and graphs of HCUP data to produce quick results. For this reason, and to protect patient confidentiality, not all types of queries are possible using HCUPnet. The full HCUP databases are purchased through the <a href="/tech_assist/centdist.jsp">HCUP Central Distributor</a> and require a statistical software package (such as SAS, SPSS, or Stata) for use. Researchers can program the software to extract the type of information they are seeking from the databases.</p>
						<p><a href="/partners.jsp">HCUP Partners</a> decide whether to release their State-level, public-release data through the HCUP Central Distributor and whether to have State-level statistics on HCUPnet. As a result, data from any given State may be available through one or both sources, and the years of participation can vary. Please review HCUPnet for a list of the available State statistics  and years included in the query system on the State statistics pathways. For the Central Distributor, a <a href="/db/availability_public.jsp">summary table</a> shows State participation by database and year. Complete database availability and pricing information is provided in the Database Catalog, which is found by navigating to the online <a href="https://www.distributor.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/Databases.aspx" target="_blank">HCUP Central Distributor</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Is the national data on HCUPnet weighted?</h3>
						<p>Yes, <a href="https://datatools.ahrq.gov/hcupnet" target="_blank">HCUPnet</a> statistics based on the NIS, KID, NRD, and NEDS have had the weighting applied and are national estimates.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>How often is HCUPnet updated?</h3>
						<p><a href="https://datatools.ahrq.gov/hcupnet" target="_blank">HCUPnet</a> is updated as databases are released. The national statistics are updated annually, and State statistics are updated as new State data are processed. Available States and years are listed on the HCUPnet pathways.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>HCUPnet provides national readmission statistics. Is this information available in a full nationwide database?</h3> 
						<p>Yes. Statistics on national readmission rates are available on <a href="https://datatools.ahrq.gov/hcupnet" target="_blank">HCUPnet</a> or can be generated using the <a href="/tech_assist/faq.jsp#nrd">NRD</a>. The NRD can be purchased through the <a href="/tech_assist/centdist.jsp">HCUP Central Distributor</a>.</p></li>
					<li>
						<h3>How does HCUPnet work?</h3>
						<p><a href="https://datatools.ahrq.gov/hcupnet" target="_blank">HCUPnet</a> is based on aggregate statistics tables to speed up data transfer and protect individual records, so not all possible queries can be addressed. <a href="https://datatools.ahrq.gov/hcupnet" target="_blank">HCUPnet</a> is designed to walk the user through each step of building a query.</p>
